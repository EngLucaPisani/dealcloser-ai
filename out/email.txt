Subject: Quick idea to improve Acme SaaS’s outreach

Hi Acme SaaS,

Noticed challenges like Low reply rates on cold outreach (<2%), Non-personalized messaging across channels, High CAC due to manual prospecting cropping up a lot.
We’re working on **AI Deal Closer — channel-aware, data-driven outreach generator** that helps teams:

- Lifts reply rates by 2–4x with tailored copy
- Multi-channel templates (Email, LinkedIn, Telegram, IG)
- Pulls ICP data from YAML/CRM to auto-personalize
- Exports ready-to-send drafts to your workflow
- Saves 3–5 hours per rep each week


If this resonates, happy to share a 3-minute demo or adapt it to your workflow.

Best,
Luca
